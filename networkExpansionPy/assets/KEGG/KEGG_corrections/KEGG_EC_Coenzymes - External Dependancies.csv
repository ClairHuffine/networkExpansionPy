In every reaction cycle, the enzyme consumes two molecules of AdoMet, each producing 5'-deoxyadenosine and a putative dethiobiotinyl carbon radical. Reaction with another equivalent of AdoMet results in abstraction of the C6 methylene pro-S hydrogen atom from 9-mercaptodethiobiotin, and the resulting carbon radical is quenched via formation of an intramolecular C-S bond, thus closing the biotin thiophane ring. The sulfur donor is believed to be the [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is sacrificed in the process, so that in vitro the reaction is a single turnover. In vivo, the [2Fe-2S] cluster can be reassembled by the Isc or Suf iron-sulfur cluster assembly systems, to allow further catalysis.","['biotin synthase', 'dethiobiotin:sulfur sulfurtransferase']",,"['6FA', 'FA8', 'FAA', 'FAB', 'FAD', 'FAE', 'FAO', 'FAS', 'FCG', 'FDA', 'FED', 'FSH', 'P5F', 'RFL', 'SFD']","['C00016', 'C01352']",,,,Flavin adenine dinucleotide,,,,Flavin adenine dinucleotide,,Sulfurtransferases.,"['C00019', 'C00073', 'C00080', 'C00120', 'C01909', 'C05198', 'C05359', 'C17023']",[],0

They can be divided into three classes: typical 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys and 1-Cys peroxiredoxins [1]. The peroxidase reaction comprises two steps centred around a redox-active cysteine called the peroxidatic cysteine. All three peroxiredoxin classes have the first step in common, in which the peroxidatic cysteine attacks the peroxide substrate and is oxidized to S-hydroxycysteine (a sulfenic acid) (see {single/111115a::mechanism}). The second step of the peroxidase reaction, the regeneration of cysteine from S-hydroxycysteine, distinguishes the three peroxiredoxin classes. For typical 2-Cys Prxs, in the second step, the peroxidatic S-hydroxycysteine from one subunit is attacked by the 'resolving' cysteine located in the C-terminus of the second subunit, to form an intersubunit disulfide bond, which is then reduced by one of several cell-specific thiol-containing reductants completing the catalytic cycle. In the atypical 2-Cys Prxs, both the peroxidatic cysteine and its resolving cysteine are in the same polypeptide, so their reaction forms an intrachain disulfide bond. The 1-Cys Prxs conserve only the peroxidatic cysteine, so its regeneration involves direct interaction with a reductant molecule. This bacterial peroxiredoxin differs from most other forms by comprising two types of subunits. One subunit (AhpC) is a typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin. Following the reduction of the substrate, one AhpC subunit forms a disulfide bond with an identical unit. The disulfide bond is reduced by the second type of subunit (AhpF). This second subunit is a flavin-containing protein that uses electrons from NADH to reduce the cysteine residues on the AhpC subunits back to their active state.","['NADH-dependent peroxiredoxin', 'ahpC (gene name)', 'ahpF (gene name)', 'alkyl hydroperoxide reductase']",,,,,,,,,,"['flavin', 'NADH']",,,Peroxidases.,"['C00001', 'C00003', 'C00004', 'C00080', 'C01335', 'C15498']",[],0

The peroxidase reaction comprises two steps centred around a redox-active cysteine called the peroxidatic cysteine. All three peroxiredoxin classes have the first step in common, in which the peroxidatic cysteine attacks the peroxide substrate and is oxidized to S-hydroxycysteine (a sulfenic acid) (see {single/111115a::mechanism}). The second step of the peroxidase reaction, the regeneration of cysteine from S-hydroxycysteine, distinguishes the three peroxiredoxin classes. For typical 2-Cys Prxs, in the second step, the peroxidatic S-hydroxycysteine from one subunit is attacked by the 'resolving' cysteine located in the C-terminus of the second subunit, to form an intersubunit disulfide bond, which is then reduced by one of several cell-specific thiol-containing reductants completing the catalytic cycle. In the atypical 2-Cys Prxs, both the peroxidatic cysteine and its resolving cysteine are in the same polypeptide, so their reaction forms an intrachain disulfide bond. To recycle the disulfide, known atypical 2-Cys Prxs appear to use thioredoxin as an electron donor. The 1-Cys Prxs conserve only the peroxidatic cysteine, so its regeneration involves direct interaction with a reductant molecule. Glutaredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxins have been reported from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. These enzymes are often able to use an alternative reductant such as thioredoxin or glutathione.","['glutaredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin', 'PRXIIB (gene name)']",,,,,,,,,,['glutathione'],,,Peroxidases.,"['C00001', 'C01335', 'C07292', 'C07293', 'C15498']",[],0
